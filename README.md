# EDUNET-PROJECT
Employee Salary Estimator
Project Overview
The Employee Salary Estimator is a simple, data-driven tool designed to estimate employee salaries based on key job-related factors such as education level, years of experience, and job role. This project uses Python and basic statistical modeling (Linear Regression) implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.

The primary goal of this project is to provide a transparent and easy-to-understand approach to salary prediction that can aid HR professionals, recruiters, or individuals looking to understand approximate salary ranges for job profiles without overt AI terminology.

Features
Simple synthetic dataset simulating employee details (education, experience, job title, salary).

Encoding of categorical features into numeric form for use in modeling.

Training of a straightforward linear regression model for salary prediction.

Evaluation on test data to demonstrate prediction accuracy.

Predict salary estimates for new employee profiles.

Beginner-friendly code with clear comments for step-by-step understanding.

Ready for extension with more data or advanced modeling techniques.

Tech Stack
Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook

Libraries:

pandas

scikit-learn (for LinearRegression and model training)

How to Use
1. Clone the Repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/employee-salary-estimator.git
cd employee-salary-estimator
2. Install Required Libraries
Make sure you have Python and pip installed. Then install dependencies:

bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
Alternatively, if using Anaconda, create an environment or install packages:

bash
conda install pandas scikit-learn
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook
Open the project notebook (e.g., EmployeeSalaryEstimator.ipynb) in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab and run the cells step-by-step:

bash
jupyter notebook Employee_Salary_Estimator.ipynb
4. Predict Salaries
Modify the section in the notebook under Step 9 to enter your own employee profiles to predict their estimated salaries.

Project Structure

Explanation of the Model
This project uses Linear Regression, a basic yet powerful technique to find relationships between input features (education, experience, job role) and the output (salary).

Categorical variables like education and job role are converted to numeric codes so the model can process them. The model is then trained on part of the data and tested on the remaining data to verify how well it predicts unseen salaries.

Limitations & Future Improvements
The current dataset is small and synthetic; real-world data is more complex.

Only a few features are used; adding certifications, performance scores, company info, location details, and market factors can improve accuracy.

Model complexity can be increased using advanced regressors or ensemble methods.

Adding data visualization to understand feature impact better.

Building a simple user interface or web app for easy HR use.

Testing for and reducing bias to ensure fairness in salary estimation.
